# Gameboy FPGA Cartridge

This repository contains the schematics and pcb layouts for a gameboy cartridge that includes a FPGA.
The pcb doesn't directly include the FPGA but is supposed to act as a "mother board" onto which an MAX1000 or CYC1000 board is soldered.
The pcb does however feature the cartridge connector pads, the level shifting of the signals, as well as a SD-card slot and an additional USB port.
